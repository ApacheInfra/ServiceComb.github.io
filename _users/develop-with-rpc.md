## Concept Description

The RPC development mode allows you to add annotations on the microservice APIs to generate the service provider agent. In this case, you can call microservices.

## Sample Code

To call a microservice, you only need to declare a member of a service API type and add the @RpcReference annotation for the member, the microservice that depends on the declaration, and the schemaID. The sample code is as follows.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import org.apache.servicecomb.foundation.common.utils.BeanUtils;
import org.apache.servicecomb.foundation.common.utils.Log4jUtils;
import org.apache.servicecomb.provider.pojo.RpcReference;
import org.apache.servicecomb.samples.common.schema.Hello;
import org.apache.servicecomb.samples.common.schema.models.Person;

@Component
public class CodeFirstConsumerMain {
    @RpcReference(microserviceName = "codefirst", schemaId = "codeFirstHello")
    private static Hello hello;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        init();
        System.out.println(hello.sayHi("Java Chassis"));
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("ServiceComb/Java Chassis");
        System.out.println(hello.sayHello(person));
    }

    public static void init() throws Exception {
        Log4jUtils.init();
        BeanUtils.init();
    }
}
```

In the preceding code, the microservice consumers have obtained the microservice API Hello of the microservice provider and declared a member of the Hello type. The annotation `@RPCReference` on `Hello` specifies the microservice name and schemaId, The ServiceComb framework can obtain information about isntances from a certain provider during program startup and generate an agent to insert to Hello. This allows you to call a remote service in the same way as you call a local class.

### Additional explanation for consumer invocation
In above example, in order to direct use `hello` in main function, we mark it as `static`. As a local field of `CodeFirstConsumerMain`, we recommend get it use these two way :

#### First way: define cse:rpc-reference
In your bean.xml, add `cse:rpc-reference` configuration:

```xml
<cse:rpc-reference id="hello" microservice-name="codefirst"
    schema-id="codeFirstHello" interface="org.apache.servicecomb.samples.common.schema.Hello"></cse:rpc-reference>
```

Then use `BeanUtils.getBean` to get `Hello` provider:

```java
Hello hello = BeanUtils.getBean("hello");
```

#### Second way: get Bean, then use field
First use `BeanUtils.getBean` to get Bean of `CodeFirstConsumerMain`:

```java
//Default instance name of Spring Bean is same as class name with first char low-cased
CodeFirstConsumerMain consumer = BeanUtils.getBean("codeFirstConsumerMain");
```

Then get `hello` via Getterï¼š

```java
public Hello getHello() {
    return hello;
}
```

```java
Hello hello = consumer.getHello()
```

> NOTE:
> `BeanUtils.getBean` has inner lock so performacen is low , we recommend use once and cache return as local field for future use(such as in constructor).
