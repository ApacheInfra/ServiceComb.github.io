ServiceComb follows the Apache way to build the community. Anyone can become a committer once they have contributed sufficiently to the project and earned the trust.

## Contribute and Earn The Trust

* [Download the releases](/release)
* [Join the mailing list](mailto:dev@servicecomb.apache.org)
* [Report bugs and/or feature requests](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SCB/)

See the [contributing](/developers/contributing) guide on how to become a contributor.

ServiceComb is a meritocracy the same as Apache. Once you have shown sufficient sustained commitment to the project and earned the trust, the PMC may invite you to be a committer.

There are multiple actions other than coding to build the trust in the ServiceComb community, code review, design discussion, user support, community outreach, documentation, project management etc. 

## New Committer Process

The ServiceComb community follows the Apache Community's [process](http://community.apache.org/newcommitter.html) on accepting a new committer.

* Start the vote in @private.
* If the vote passes, send an offer to become a committer with @private CC'ed.
* Add the committer to the [team page](/developers/team)
* [Setup committer rights](/developers/setup-committer-rights/)
