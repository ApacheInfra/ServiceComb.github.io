## Install Java development environment

* Install Git, details can refer to [Git Installing Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){:target="_blank"}.

* Install JDK 1.8, details can refer to [JDK Installing Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html){:target="_blank"}.

* Install Maven 3.x, details can refer to [Maven Installing Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html){:target="_blank"}.

* Install ServiceComb Java Chassis(SDK) by executing the following commands.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ServiceComb/ServiceComb-Java-Chassis.git
   cd ServiceComb-Java-Chassis
   mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs
   ```

## Run Service Center
**Service Center** enables capabilities of service registration and service discovery in **ServiceComb**. It can run inside docker.
```bash
docker pull servicecomb/service-center
docker run -d -p 30100:30100 servicecomb/service-center:latest
```
*Reference to [service center deployment](/users/setup-environment/#运行service-center) to learn deploying Service Center as a local binary.*   

## Create your first microservice application
Let\'s start the journey of microservice with a simple **Body Mass Index(BMI)** application. The [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index){:target="_blank"} is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass in an individual. This application contains two separate microservices:

* **BMI calculator service**：A microservice provides calculation of BMI.

* **Web service**：A microservice provides both user interface and gateway service.

The workflow of the application is shown as follows:

Note that the dotted lines indicate the process of service registration and discovery.

## Run microservice application

1. Enter BMI codes directory.

   ```bash
   cd samples/bmi
   ```

   **Note**: In windows development environment, the docker runs inside the virtual machine. The IP address of **Service Center** needs to be modified as the virtual machine\'s IP address. Modify the 2 configuration files [calculator\|webapp]/src/main/resources/microservice.yaml, changed <a>http://127.0.0.1:30100</a> to <a>http://192.168.99.100:30100</a> , where 192.168.99.100 is the virtual machine\'s IP address.

2. Run microservices.

   ```bash
   cd calculator; mvn spring-boot:run
   cd webapp; mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Verify the application. Visit <a>http://localhost:8888</a> in browser. Then input your height and weight to verify.
