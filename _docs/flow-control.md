Flow control mechanism controls the transmission speed to avoid microservices being overloaded. This guide shows how to use flow control with **ServiceComb** in the BMI application. 

## Before you start

Walk through [Develop microservice application in minutes](/docs/quick-start-bmi/) and have **BMI application** running. 

## Enable

1. Add flow control dependency in `pom.xml` of *BMI calculator service*:

   ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.servicecomb</groupId>
      <artifactId>handler-flowcontrol-qps</artifactId>
    </dependency>
   ```

2. Add handler chain and configurations of flow control in `microservice.yaml` of *BMI calculator service*:

   ```yaml
   cse:
     handler:
       chain:
         Provider:
           default: qps-flowcontrol-provider
     flowcontrol:
       Provider:
         qps:
           limit:
             gateway: 1
   ```

The above configurations have already set up in the code. All you need to do is to stop all **BMI calculator services** and then start a new one with the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Dcse.handler.chain.Provider.default=qps-flowcontrol-provider -Dcse.flowcontrol.Provider.qps.limit.gateway=1"
```

## Verification

Visit <a>http://localhost:8889</a>. Input a positive height and weight and then click *Submit* button twice or more in less than one second. You will see the web page change from the left one to the right one.
