When we scale up *BMI calculator service*, requests from *BMI web service* need to distribute equally to each *BMI calculator service*. This guide shows how to use load balance with **ServiceComb** in the BMI application. 

## Before you start

Walk through [Develop microservice application in minutes](/docs/quick-start-bmi/) and have **BMI application** running. 

## Enable

The simple embedded load balancer will be used by default. No extra configurations needed.

## Verification

Run one more *BMI calculator service* with the following command: 
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Dcse.rest.address=0.0.0.0:7778"
```

To better distinguish different running instances, we added a new interface that returns instance id in the implementation of BMI calculator, details can refer to [the implementation of BMI calculator](https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/samples/bmi/calculator). Besides, a different service port is needed to avoid port conflict.

Now you can see the instance id in the following figures shows up alternately by clicking the *Submit* button.
