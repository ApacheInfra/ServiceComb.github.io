This guide shows how to reinforce microservices with **ServiceComb**\'s handler chain. From here you can learn how to use ServiceComb\'s handler chain by the following links below:

* [Load Balance](/docs/quick-start-advance/load-balance/). Distribute requests equally among service instances.

* [Flow Control](/docs/quick-start-advance/flow-control/). Limit number of requests of a microservice.

* [Service Management](/docs/quick-start-advance/service-management). Isolate abnormal services and stop cascading failure in microservice application.

* [Distributed Tracing](/docs/quick-start-advance/distributed-tracing). Visualize the flow of requests through microservices.

## What's next

* See [ServiceComb User Guide](/users/user-guide/)

* Learn more from [the Company application](/docs/linuxcon-workshop-demo/) for a more complete example of microservice applications integrated with ServiceComb
